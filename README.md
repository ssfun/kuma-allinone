# Open WebUI Dockerfile for Choreo

# Version

v0.8.0

# Releases

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-12


> [!CAUTION]
> ⚠️ **Database Migrations**: This release includes database schema changes; we strongly recommend backing up your database and all associated data before upgrading in production environments. If you are running a multi-worker, multi-server, or load-balanced deployment, all instances must be updated simultaneously, rolling updates are not supported and will cause application failures due to schema incompatibility.

> [!WARNING]
> ⚠️ **Long-Running Database Migration**: This release includes a migration for the `chat_message` table that can take a significant amount of time to complete, especially in larger deployments with extensive chat histories. Please plan for adequate downtime and allow the migration to finish completely without interruption.

### Added

- 📊 **Analytics dashboard.** Administrators now have access to an Analytics dashboard showing model usage statistics, token consumption by model and user, user activity rankings, and time-series charts with hourly or daily granularity; clicking any model opens a detail view with feedback history, associated tags, and chat browser, and results can be filtered by user group. [#21106](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/pull/21106), [Commit](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/68a1e87b66a7ec8831d5ed52940c4ef110e3e264), [Commit](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/e62649f94044abfed4d7d60647a2050383a67e3d)
- 🎯 **Experimental support for Skills.** Open WebUI now supports the Skill standard — allowing users to create and manage reusable AI skills with detailed instructions, reference them in chats using the "$" command, or attach them to specific models for automatic context in conversations. [#21312](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/pull/21312)
- 🧪 **Experimental support for Open Responses protocol.** Connections can now be configured to use the experimental Open Responses protocol instead of Chat Completions, enabling native support for extended thinking, streaming reasoning tokens, and richer tool call handling for compatible providers.

### Changed

- ‼️ **Database Migration Required** — This release includes database schema changes; multi-worker, multi-server, or load-balanced deployments must update all instances simultaneously rather than performing rolling updates, as running mixed versions will cause application failures due to schema incompatibility between old and new instances.
- ⚠️ **Chat Message Table Migration** — This release includes a new chat message table migration that can take a significant amount of time to complete in larger deployments with extensive chat histories. Administrators should plan for adequate maintenance windows and allow the migration to complete fully without interruption. Running the migration with insufficient time or resources may result in data integrity issues.
- 🔗 **Prompt ID-based URLs.** Prompts now use unique ID-based URLs instead of command-based URLs, allowing more flexible command renaming without breaking saved links or integrations. [#20945](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/pull/20945)
